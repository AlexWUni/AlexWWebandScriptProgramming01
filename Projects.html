        <h3> Python Based Word Guessing Game </h3>
        <p> This project was made as the final project for Introduction to Programming. 
          It was a program that runs a game where the user can guess the letters in a word to create the word with a user entered amount of attempts.
          It used for loops, while loops, if statements, lists and python's random functions to pick a random word and have the user guess the word letter by letter.

        <h3> Python Based Encryption Machine </h3>
        <p> This project was made as the final project for Object Oriented Programming.
          The program accepted user inputs and encrypted them until the user inputed "STOP". 
          It then it printed out all previous inputs, encrypted and decrypted via class methods, and the encryption method used.
          It made use of object oriented programming concepts, such as custom classes and abstract classes.
